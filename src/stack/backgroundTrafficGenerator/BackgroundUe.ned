//
// This module implements a lightweight model for a 4G or 5G User Equipment (UE).
// It is used to simulate the generation of background traffic in both uplink and
// downlink bandwidth, according to the logic specified by its ~ITrafficGenerator 
// submodule. Generated traffic is not actually transmitted/received by this module,
// making it more efficient from the simulation complexity perspective.
// Instead, such traffic modifies the buffer status information that is used by the
// ~BackgroundScheduler to allocate resources.
// Each background UE has a mobility submodule to configure its position in the 
// simulation floorplan. This way, realistic channel status information can be 
// computed for the background UE and used by the ~BackgroundScheduler.
// Since this module does not send/receive actual traffic, application-level 
// statistics are not produced.
