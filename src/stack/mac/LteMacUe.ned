// User Equipment (UE) Medium Access Control (MAC) layer of Long-Term Evolution (LTE) stack
//
// This module manages the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer functionalities for User Equipment (UE) 
// within the LTE network. It is responsible for essential MAC operations like scheduling, buffer 
// management, and handling uplink/downlink transmissions. This includes interacting with the 
// physical layer (PHY) and Radio Link Control (RLC) layer to ensure efficient data transfer over the 
// LTE network. The LteMacUe module is crucial for supporting various network services and 
// maintaining high-performance communications in the 5G ecosystem.
