//# MECPlatformManager module
//
// This module implements the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) platform manager (MECPM)
// entity within a MEC system. It serves as a conduit between the MEC orchestrator 
// and MEC host modules. Its primary role is to instantiate and terminate MEC applications 
// based on the orchestrator's requests, managing the lifecycle of these applications 
// and ensuring they are properly integrated within the virtualization infrastructure 
// and service registry.
