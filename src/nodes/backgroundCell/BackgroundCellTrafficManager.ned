//
// This is the traffic manager for background UEs within a
// background cell, which does not have the protocol stack
//
// This manager handles the traffic scheduling and control
// for background user equipments (UEs) by interfacing with
// the background cell's components such as the scheduler,
// AMC, and channel model. It provides functionalities to manage
// resource blocks, compute CQI based on the SINR, handle
// RAC signaling, and calculate received power.
