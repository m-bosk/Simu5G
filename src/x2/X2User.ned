// The `X2User` module interface is a foundational component in the Simu5G framework,
// providing the necessary parameters and gate definitions for modules that need to 
// communicate with the X2 Manager. It is designed to standardize the communication 
// protocols between different modules and the X2 Manager, ensuring efficient and 
// reliable data exchange in LTE network simulations. The module comes with a 
// predefined display icon for easy visualization.
