//
// The BackgroundTrafficManager is responsible for overseeing background traffic
// management for UEs within a simulated cell. It ensures the effective handling
// of background traffic by coordinating with various components of the e/gNB's 
// protocol stack. This module supports assigning resource blocks, managing 
// interference, and updating CQIs for background UEs, thus playing a crucial role 
// in simulating realistic traffic conditions in LTE/5G networks.
