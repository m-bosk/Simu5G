//
// Interface for the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer of LTE Stack.
// 
// The LteMac moduleinterface provides the definition for the MAC layer
// in the LTE network. It serves as an intermediary between the Radio Link
// Control (RLC) layer and the Physical (PHY) layer, facilitating the transmission
// and control of data packets. The MAC layer is responsible for various 
// functions such as scheduling, HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request), 
// and traffic prioritization, ensuring efficient and reliable communication 
// in the LTE network.
