package simu5g.corenetwork.trafficFlowFilter;

//
// The TrafficFlowFilter module maps IP 4-Tuples to TFT identifiers, identifying a bearer and associating it 
// with an ID recognizable by the first GTP-U entity. It interacts with the LTE Binder to determine the packet's
// destination. This module can reside in both eNodeBs and PGWs. At the PGW, it finds the destination endpoint 
// (eNodeB serving the destination UE) of the GTP tunnel to be established. At the eNodeB, the destination endpoint 
// is typically the PGW, but if the fastForwarding flag is enabled and the destination is within the same cell, 
// the packet is relayed to the Radio interface directly.
