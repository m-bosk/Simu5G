import inet.mobility.single.LinearMobility;

//
// This module extends the INET's Linear Mobility model to mimic the movement of
// a vehicle moving across roads with interserctions regulated by traffic lights.
// The node implementing this mobility model moves at constant speed and, if it 
// encounters a ~TrafficLight module whose color is "red", then it stops until the
// traffic light's color becomes "green". When resuming its movement, the node may
// change its direction if the "enableTurns" parameter is enabled. It requires the
// presence of ~TrafficLight modules in the same network scenario.
