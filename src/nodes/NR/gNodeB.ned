//
// This module represents a gNodeB (Next Generation Node B) in a 5G New Radio (NR) network.
// It extends the eNodeB module, integrating NR-specific components and functionalities.
// The gNodeB acts as a base station in 5G networks, handling both user and control plane traffic.
// It supports various advanced features such as Carrier Aggregation, Dual Connectivity, and others
// which are essential for high data rates and low latency communications in 5G networks.
